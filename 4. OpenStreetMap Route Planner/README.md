# OpenStreetMap Route Planner using A* Search

This project is done in C++ using real map data and A* search to find a path between two points, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application.

The project you will will write will be using data from the OpenStreetMap project.
The OpenStreetMap project is an open source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.

## OpenStreetMap Data
OpenStreetMap data can come in several different formats. The data that is used for this project comes in the form of an OSM XML file (.osm file)

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```shell
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```shell
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```shell
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```



## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```shell
./test
```
